## Introduction

Welcome to the Snake game built using the Pygame library! This classic arcade-style game challenges you to control a snake, help it grow by eating food, and avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

## Prerequisites

Before you start playing, make sure you have the following requirements met:

- Python 3.x installed
- Pygame library installed (`pip install pygame`)
